# Project Overview

Airbnb is one of the most popular ways to find a place to stay in most major cities around the world. It has significantly altered the traditional method of locating accommodations for both short and long-term stays. we'd like to focus on the following issues that have been raised:  

• What is the seasonal pattern of Airbnb in Chicago?  
• What kinds of Airbnb homes are popular?  
• What are the most influential features about the rental price?  


This project's results will assist businesses in narrowing their target marketing customer base to the most likely prospective customers, and it will also assist businesses in understanding how various attributes influence the client's decision to accept or reject the Airbnb home.

# Dataset description 

Airbnb does not release any data on the listings in its marketplace, but a separate group named Inside Airbnb scrapes 
and compiles publicly available information about many cities Airbnb's listings from the Airbnb website. For this project, 
their data set scraped on September 14, 2022, on the city of Chicago, Illinois is used. It contains information on all Chicago 
Airbnb listings that were live on the site on that date (over 7,400). 
The dataset is publicly available and link to the dataset is: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/
The data has certain limitations. Most noticeable one is that it scrapes the advertised price rather than the actual price paid by 
the previous customer. There are also missing values in many fields w hich needed to be cleaned based on their importance.
From the downloaded dataset we would like to use the following csv datasets. 
1) Calender.csv 
- I t contains 10,48,575 row s w ith 7 columns. 
2) Listings.csv 
- I t contains 7,414 row s w ith 75 columns. 
3) Review s.csv 
- I t contains 3,43,394 row s w ith 6 columns. 

Some of the more important features this project will look into the following: accommodates, bedrooms, bathrooms, beds, price, 
minimum_nights, maximum_nights and number_of_reviews.

# Data Cleaning 

Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. 

-> Dropped the columns which were not informative such as id and name for our price prediction.  
-> Dropped the columns that were informative but difficult to deal with because they required NLP for further analysis.  
-> Only "neighbourhood cleansed" is required as a feature of home location, which allowed us to eliminate other columns that are related to location.  
-> Identified and eliminated all the duplicate columns and rows.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In terms of EDA, we attempted to address our primary goals. 

Below Timeplot depicts the Seasonal pattern of Airbnb in Chicago which shows highest occupancy rate was in September 2022 and the lowest was in December 2022.

Below Timeplot depicts the Seasonal price of Airbnb in Chicago which shows due to the summer, the rental price was less expensive in October 2022 and more expensive from May 2023.

We defined popular homes by using a 70% threshold, plotted it with Bar Plot, and visualized it and you can see them below.

We learned that the following factors had the greatest impact on the rental price:  
Property type - Entire Rental Unit was preferred more.  
Host response time - Within an hour was preferred more.  
Instant bookable - was preferred more

## Machine Learning Models

1) Predicting the Rental Prices of Airbnb data in chicago
a) XGBoost
Now that the data preprocessing is over, we can start applying different Supervised Machine Learning models. The evaluation metrics used will be mean squared error and r-squared. Boosting is an ensemble technique where new models are added to correct the errors made by existing models. Models are added sequentially until no further improvements can be made. GBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance. Is a very popular algorithm that has recently been dominating applied machine learning for structured or tabular data.

#### RMSE value – 0.3459

b) Random Forest
A random forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is constructed from decision tree algorithms. It’s more accurate than the decision tree algorithm.

#### RMSE value – 0.2775


## Conclusion
Conclusion 
We spread the work evenly amongst ourselves in each and every section, such as data cleansing, EDA, and models. Three important takeaways from this project for me was good collaboration with the team members, proper analysis of large real time datasets and overall how important and difficult it would be to work on multiple problem statements. If we had more time, we would have come up with some intriguing ideas by evaluating the datasets, categorizing them based on reviews from other datasets and presenting some more specific graphs that would be useful to Airbnb hosts.
If I was given a chance to redo the problem again, I would initially think of an additional overall question such as price prediction considering factors such as reviews, amenities which would help in determining the price in more real time and precise mannner.
