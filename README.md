# Project Overview

Airbnb is one of the most popular ways to find a place to stay in most major cities around the world. It has significantly altered the traditional method of locating accommodations for both short and long-term stays. we'd like to focus on the following issues that have been raised:  

• What is the seasonal pattern of Airbnb in Chicago?  
• What kinds of Airbnb homes are popular?  
• What are the most influential features about the rental price?  


This project's results will assist businesses in narrowing their target marketing customer base to the most likely prospective customers, and it will also assist businesses in understanding how various attributes influence the client's decision to accept or reject the Airbnb home.
